# GTA Trilogy Chaos Mod
Welcome to the official GTA Trilogy Chaos Mod repository!

This repository, together with this README, is still very much WIP.

## What does this mod do?
Similar to the old [Vice City Chaos% mod](https://github.com/Lighnat0r-pers/gta-vc-chaos) by [Lightnat0r](https://github.com/Lighnat0r), it activates effects in the corresponding game every X seconds / minutes (cooldown can be defined in the GUI tool).

## Which GTA games does it support?
It started off as a mod for **San Andreas**, which is the one that is mainly supported right now.  
However, there is already basic support for **Vice City** and **III** implemented. It will take longer to bring all (if possible) custom effects over, and also implement their corresponding ingame cheats though.

## Which versions of the games does it support?
**GTA San Andreas**: v1.0 US  
**GTA Vice City**: v1.0 US  
**GTA III**: v1.0 US

## How do I downgrade my game to the required version?
There's a handy thread over on the GTA Forums that has downgraders vor GTA III, Vice City and even San Andreas.  
https://gtaforums.com/topic/936600-iii-iv-various-gta-downgraders/

## What ASI Loader is recommended to play the mod with?
I **highly** recommend using the [Ultimate ASI Loader](https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader) by [ThirteenAG](https://github.com/ThirteenAG) purely due to the fact that it supports saving CrashDumps.

You can find the latest release here: https://github.com/ThirteenAG/Ultimate-ASI-Loader/releases/latest  

Download the `Ultimate-ASI-Loader.zip` file (not the `_x64.zip` one)  
It will contain a file called `dinput8.dll` - move the file to your GTA directory.  
Now rename it to `vorbisFile.dll` and replace the original.  
(Good for people that use the `dinput8.dll` mouse fix. Also the only way I personally got the ASI Loader to work)

Silent's ASI Loader works as well, but if you want to open an issue with some crashes I'll be closing any that do not have crash dumps.

Depending on which ASI Loader you picked, the files differ in size a bit:
- `vorbisFile.dll` (Ultimate ASI Loader): 2,102KB / 2,152,448 bytes
- `vorbisFile.dll` (Silent's ASI Loader): 53KB / 53,760 bytes

The reason why the Ultimate ASI Loader is **WAY BIGGER** in size is because it supports more than just the original `vorbisFile.dll`, comes with an additional windowed mode feature, a ["d3d8 to d3d9" pseudo-driver](https://github.com/crosire/d3d8to9) and a crash handler.

If you don't need any of that, Silent's ASI Loader will be all you need.

## How do I download the mod then?
Head on over to the the `Releases` tab or [click here](https://github.com/gta-chaos-mod/asi-script/releases/latest).

Installation is as simple as installing an ASI Loader (see previous section) and copying all the files into your game directory. (So the `chaos_mod` folder, the `scripts` folder and the `.exe`)

The `.exe` can be anywhere you want, as long as it has write permissions since it automatically saves the settings in a file called `config.cfg` in the same directory.

**You also need to have [.NET Framework 4.7.2](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-framework/net472) installed.**

## ... and how do I use it?
Simple:
1. Start the game
2. Launch the corresponding `Trilogy Chaos Mod.exe`
3. Now you have 2 options:
	1. Either press `Auto-Start` in the GUI, which will make it wait for you starting a new game and skipping the first cutscene (just like the autosplitter when doing a speedrun)
	2. Or you just press `Start` right away
4. Suffer

## Is there a list of all effects?
Of course! Here's a [spreadsheet](http://bit.ly/gta-sa-chaos-mod) that has all of them!

## How do I load the last autosave when ingame?
Hold down `Left CTRL` when hovering over the `Load Game` option in the menu.

## Where are the autosaves being saved to?
Inside a sub-directory called `chaos_mod` in your corresponding GTA User Files folder.

## How do I setup the Twitch voting?
In the Twitch tab you have to fill out the `Channel`, `Username` and `OAuth Token` fields.

Channel: *The channel you want to have the voting in*  
Username: *The username of the account to do the voting from (can be your own, can be a channel moderator)*  
OAuth Token: *An OAuth Token for the specified username (Can be generated [here](https://twitchtokengenerator.com/quick/xnaEGgziJl))*

## How do I use the polls feature for Twitch voting?
Polls are still very experimental due to Twitch not offering a decent-- err, an API at all, to utilize them.

SirStendec was kind enough to provide a FrankerFaceZ Add-On that provides access to the polls functionality.

First make sure to enable `Use Twitch Polls For Votes` in the `Settings` tab.

![https://i.imgur.com/nj6hRWU.png](https://i.imgur.com/nj6hRWU.png)

To use it, first you need to install [FrankerFaceZ](https://www.frankerfacez.com/) in your browser.

Navigate to your dashboard and open the FrankerFaceZ control center (upside-down FrankerZ icon in the top right next to your user avatar).  
Then head into `Add-Ons`, scroll down until you see `Add Unlisted...`, type in `poll-shim` and click `Add`.  
Afterwards, make sure to install said Add-On.

Now head into the Poll-Shim menu to the left (or click on `Settings` after installing it).

Make sure `Enable Poll-Shim` is checked and enter any passphrase into the `Passphrase` field.  
The passphrase you have entered also needs to be put into the GTA Trilogy Chaos Mod program.

Also make sure to have your dashboard open (or, optionally, after doing this setup, a popout chat from your channel will work, too).

## My game's crashing!
Great! Create an issue with the `.log` and `.dmp` files from the `CrashDumps` folder. (Best to archive them into a `.zip` file or similar)

## I have a suggestion for an effect!
Also great! Feel free to create an issue with that as well, best to explain what it should do in detail.

It could be that it is pretty much impossible to implement, or that I just won't consider working on it because there are already effects that are similar to it though, so keep that in mind.

## I hate you!
Right back at you üòâ

## **ATTENTION, ALL STREAMERS!**
You don't have to, but it'd be amazing if you could tag your streams with `#chaos` or something similar, maybe even tweet it out with the `#GTA_Chaos_Mod` hashtag.

I wouldn't mind potentially dropping by and seeing you guys suffer with the mod üòÅ
